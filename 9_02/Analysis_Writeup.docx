 Question 8

a) The full summary is as follows:

	I)
Yes, there is a relationship between the response and the predictor, as we have 2 non-zero coefficients (B0 = 39.935 and B1 = -.0158), each of which are significant at a level of p-value = essentially 0 (as shown by the coefficients section of the table)

ii) The relationship is fairly strong between the response and the predictor, as we have an R^2 value of .6059. This is not super strong, but is strong enough to suggest a relationship, as around 60% of the variation in mpg can be accounted for by the change in horsepower

iii) The relationship is a negative relationship between mpg and horsepower, since the B1 coefficient is negative. As horsepower goes up, mpg goes down.

Other requests)
I extracted the coefficients as such:






RSE: 4.906


95% confidence intervals:
RSE for B0: .717
RSE for B1: .006

B0: 
[38.5, 41.37]


B1:
[-.17, -.145]
