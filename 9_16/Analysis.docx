a) I used the median function to pull out the median from the Auto$mpg column, and then used two lines to create a vector of 0s and 1s based on if the mpg is > median_mpg

b) Here are some plots in order of how I checked some relationships: Box between mpg01 and # of cylinders, Box between mpg01 and acceleration, Box between mpg01 and weight, and scatterplot between mpg01 and displacement. The box plots all show a positive relationship between mpg01 and the corresponding measure, while the plot shows a negative relationship.

c) I created an index column in a set of the randomized data, and then for the training set took the first 300 values, and test set the last 92 values

f) After fitting a logic model, I created a confusion matrix and found the mean of correct guesses for mpo01 based on cylinders, displacement, weight, and acceleration. Pretty decent test results!



Question AG 3.7

a) The linear model performed very poorly, with an R^2 of 1.562. Both coefficients were considered significant, but overall the model was not good.

c) By fitting the model to a logistic regression, both coefficients are still considered significant. By manipulating the p(x) we can get the logit of weight = 5.2 as shown:

Question AG 3.8

a) The probit model performed just as well as the regular logistic regression model did. 

b) Our prediction for pi_hat is very confidently close to 1

c) The difference between quartiles accounts for a 33% change in probability that the crab has a satellite
